 QUESTIONS:
  Can I access props some how through the event object if I declare it in the same file.
  Can I pass props to this function. What I was trying was a single event handler for the
  buttons and the wanted to pass value along to the component.?

function onChangeSomething(e){
   e.target.props
   props.value
}

const A = (props)=> <div className="box-a" onClick={onChangeSomething}> button A </div>
const B = (props)=> <div className="box-b" onClick={onChangeSomething}> button A </div>



 What is the difference between 
 import A from './a';
 import {A} frp, './a';
Why does it work sometimes and not others.
    ie export defaul A
    however export A   must use {}
    
Is there a way to export default a list of SFC like so:
What is the purpose of export why do I need it?

 import { GalleryImage, GalleryHeading, NextSlide, PreviousSlide } from './components';
